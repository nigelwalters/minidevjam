# Mini DevJam

Welcome to the Apigee mini hands on DevJam workshop.

# Getting Started

  In this workshop, you will get first hand exposure to Apigee Edge, the full featured enterprise API Management platform. To get started with Apigee Edge, you will need to get access to an Apigee instance. 


  If you're new to Apigee, visit this page to create an account: <a href="https://apigee.com/edge" target="_blank">https://apigee.com/edge</a>

  You will be presented with a sign in form as shown here:
